Laser in the top mid and bottom of storage/acq
limelight is at 60.755 degrees
255 mapping for moving around the field
shooter needs lots of different math and pid, endgame will need trig
balls will stop after they go thru the entire Laser
three lasers on the robot, at least 1 limit switch
controls board will go on the side of storage, need to find space for air tanks
shoot and move at the same time

Shooter Notes:
    always rotating looking for target
    once the laser had been triggered in storage start booster/shooter motors (should be fast)
    Once the limelight has found the target do the math and then adjust all the systems accordingly
    it'll run like:
        Limelight lock
        booster/shooter wheel
        Move the hood
        fire
    240 degrees of clearance for shooter turret
    Hood should change more than the wheel velocity

    Data stored in .csv on the pi, roborio queries the pi for a set distance and it returns a velocity

Endgame Notes:
    Auto endgame
    extend 34 inches tall
    Rotating arm motor needs to be in brake mode
    Endgame Process:
        extend
        Engage the ratchet and retract
        Rotate the second arm to the bar and latch on
        Slide arm retracts and free's it's self from the bar
        begin rotating the robot
        extend slide arm to grab second bar
        retract slides and rotating arm will be free
        Repeat until at the top
